# RileyLink-Water-Resistant-Wireless-Charging-Case
Water Resistant Wireless Charging Case for the RileyLink

This repository is for STL files used to make a water resistant wireless charging case for your RileyLink.
V2 is a highly refined revision from over 10 physical prototype iterations that have undergone 30 day hand carry, multiple drop tests, and immersion testing. The prototypes were produced with a FormLabs Form2 SLA machine. This design will not work with a printer with worse than 100Âµm resolution.
